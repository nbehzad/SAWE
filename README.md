# SAWE
**SAWE** is a sentiment aware word embedding that has been achieved from the refinement of Word2vec and GloVe pretrained word embeddings using the approach proposed in my paper entitled [Sentiment Aware Word Embeddings Using Refinement and Senti-Contextualized Learning Approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231220304811)

The refined word embeddings of Glove model [(glove.840B.300d)](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip) and word2vec model [(GoogleNews-negative300)](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) are available in the **embeddings** directory.
