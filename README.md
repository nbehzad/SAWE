# SAWE
**SAWE** are sentiment aware word embeddings that have been achieved from the refinement of Word2vec and GloVe pretrained word embeddings using the approach proposed in my paper entitled [Sentiment Aware Word Embeddings Using Refinement and Senti-Contextualized Learning Approach]

All the source codes and materials used in my paper will be published in this page soon.
The refined word embeddings of Glove model [glove.840B.300d](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip) and word2vec model [GoogleNews-negative300] are available in the **embeddings** directory.
